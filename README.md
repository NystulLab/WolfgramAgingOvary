# Nystul Lab Template Repo

This repository contains scripts for the figures and single cell RNA sequencing analysis for the Aging Ovary Project.

## Folder structure

- `Code/`  
  Analysis scripts, notebooks, and reusable functions (R, Python, etc.).

- `Data/`  
  Small/processed data that can reasonably live in git (CSV, RDS, small TIFFs, etc.).  
  **Do not** put huge raw data here; use `LargeImages/` or external storage.

- `Results/`  
  Output from analyses: figures, tables, summary data, etc.
